This is a little test script for Alex B.

1. Download the two files
2. Run the command "python -m http.server" so that you can run the scripts locally
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/downloads/index.html (the file path will vary)
4. JSON will be displayed in browser as HTML

There were different ways to do this but I did it was with JS 'fetch()'
